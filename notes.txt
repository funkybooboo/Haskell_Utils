--Haskell Syntax
-Haskell only knows functions!* No variables
func x y = <expr>

- function-name arguments = body
-function that squares a number
square x = x * x
-spaces to separate function name and arguments

magnitude x y = sqrt (square x + square y)
-use () to group outputs for inputs

-Types
func :: x -> y -> z
- func-name :: argumentType1 -> argumentType2 -> returnType

square :: Integer -> Integer
square x = x * x

foo :: a -> b -> c
- any type will do for all 3

foo :: a -> a -> a
- any type will do but they all need to be the same type

foo :: a -> a -> b
- any input type will do but the output type needs to be different

-standard library
head :: [a] -> a

square :: a -> a
square x = x * x
- error
- * only applies to numbers

square :: Num a => a -> a
square x = x * x
- a is an instance of Num

-Currying
magnitude :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
magnitude x y = sqrt (square x + square y)
foo = magnitude 5
- no error!
- because foo has become a new function with this type
foo :: Integer -> Integer
this has this effect on magnitude
magnitude :: Integer -> Integer
- as if we shaved off one of the arguments

-if-else?
foo = if <condition> then <true_expr> else <false_expr>
-no else-if

-pattern matching
zeroToOne 0 = 1
zeroToOne x = x
- haskell will check all the defined functions starting from the top and once it finds a fit it will use that definition for this run
- order in which you define functions matters

-Guards
sign x | x > 0 = 1
       | x < 0 = -1
       | otherwise = 0

-Let-in and where
magnitude = let
    sqMag = square x + square y
    in
    sqrt sqMag

magnitude = sqrt sqMag
    where sqMag = square x + square y

- Lists
- haskell lists are linked lists

somelist :: [Integer]
somelist = [1, 2, 3]
somelist = 1 : (2 : (3 : []))
- cons = :
- cons link to the previous list
- nil = []
- nil is the empty list or end of a list
(x:xs)
- x is the current item
- xs is the remaining items

- Graham Mutton's approach to recursion
1. write down name and type
2. write down cases
3. define base cases
4. define recursion cases
5. generalize and simplify

- Examples!

- Factorial
- n! = n * (n-1)!, 0! = 1
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)

- Sum a list of numbers
sum :: Num a => [a] -> a
sum [] = 0
sum (x:xs) = x + sum xs

- Take first N elements from a list
take :: Integer -> [a] -> [a]
take 0 [] = []
take n [] = []
take 0 (x:xs) = []
take n (x:xs) = x : take (n - 1) xs
-using step 5 of recursion you can get it to look like this
take :: Integer -> [a] -> [a]
take 0 _ = []
take _ [] = []
take n (x:xs) = x : take (n - 1) xs
- because we aren't using _ in our definition _ is a good name

- Haskell using lazy evaluation
firstSquares :: Num a => a -> [a] -> [a]
firstSquares n xs = take n (squareAll xs)
- haskell doesn't square everything in xs. It only squares what is needed.

naturals = [1..]
- this function is infinite but haskell only evaluates what is needed
- this is a more robust way to write it
naturals = naturalsFrom 1
naturalsFrom x = x : naturalsFrom (x + 1)

- List Comprehension
[<expr> | x <- xs]

squareAll :: Num a => [a] -> [a]
squareAll xs [x * x | x <- xs]


- Built-in functions
base
- common functions, types, etc.
Hoogle
- search by: function name, function type, module

- Higher order functions
foo :: (a -> b) -> c
        ^ function
fn :: Num a => a -> a -> a
fn x y = x + y
bar = foo fn

- Lambda notation
foo :: (a -> b) -> c
bar = foo (\x y -> x + y)
           ^ Anonymous function

- the most common base function
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map fn [] = []
map fn (x:xs) = fn x : map fn xs
- mapping a function onto a list

- Factorio in programing!

zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
zipWith (+) xs ys
    -    ^ pair-wise sums

filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filter even xs
